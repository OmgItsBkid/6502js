# 6502js
A JavaScript 6502 assembler and simulator

Elements moved around to give a more IDE feel for developing on the 6502js, along with a few other small changes.

Branched from [jborza's version](https://github.com/jborza/6502js) which itself is a branch of the original [6502js](https://github.com/skilldrick/6502js) .

I do not pretend to know anything about CSS, and barely anything about HTML, however I was able to poke around and get everything just about how I wanted it to look.
